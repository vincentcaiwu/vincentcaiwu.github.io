<Abstract>In this paper, we develop an exact closed-form series expansion for the economic index of riskiness of general gambles in terms of moments information. Important special cases include the economic indexes of riskinesses proposed in Aumann and Serrano (2008); Bali et al. (2011); Foster and Hart (2009). Based on the closed-form formula, we characterize further theoretical properties for the economic index of riskiness. Numerical examples confirm the accuracy of the proposed closed-form formula.

Submitted to _European Actuarial Journal_.
  - In this paper, we derive an exact explicit formula for the adjustment coefficient, which is the unique positive solution of the corresponding Lundberg equation. It is a key quantity in the classical Cram ́er-Lundberg risk theory, and is a fundamental building block for the celebrated Lundberg inequality for ruin probabilities. We utilize the Lagrange inversion theorem and derive the explicit exact formula in terms of series expansions. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the formula.

  - In this paper, we present the theoretical foundation for the optimality of the variance of the 'empirical martingale simulation'(EMS) estimator first introduced in \cite{duan1998empirical}. The EMS estimator is proposed to be an improvement of the traditional Monte Carlo estimator, and is shown to yield smaller variance in numerical examples in the literature. However, there is no theoretical guarantee for the superior performance as compared to the traditional Monte Carlo. This paper is the first to rigorously examine this issue and justify the benefits of the EMS estimator in reducing the overall variance. We establish the conditions under which the asymptotic variance of the EMS estimator is smaller than that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator.  This addresses the open questions proposed in Duan and Simonato (1998), Duan et al. (2001) and Yuan and Chen (2009). In particular, we show that the EMS estimator always reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo method in the Black-Scholes model through the novel use of Stein's lemma. We also discuss when the EMS estimator is not effective in reducing the variance. Then we illustrate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments and explicit concrete examples.

- [Valuation of VIX derivatives through combined Ito-Taylor expansion and Markov Chain approximation](), with [Zhenyu Cui](https://sites.google.com/site/zhenyucui86/home?authuser=0), [Chihoon Lee](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/clee4) and Mingzhe Liu. Submitted to _Journal of Derivatives_.
  - We propose a novel analytical method to valuate VIX derivatives under the general class of (affine and non-affine) stochastic volatility models,  which extends the current literature. The approach is based on a closed-form approximation of the VIX through the Ito-Taylor expansion and the subsequent continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximation to valuate VIX derivatives. The formula is in explicit closed-form and does not involve numerical inversions, in contrast to the existing literature. Numerical experiments with  several stochastic volatility models  demonstrate that it is accurate and efficient by comparing with benchmarks in the literature and Monte Carlo simulations.
