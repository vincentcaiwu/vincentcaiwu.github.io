I am **Cai Wu (吴偲)**, a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Economics](https://econ.fudan.edu.cn/en/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). My primary research interests include financial engineering, stochastic analysis and operations research. I am currently seeking for a Ph.D. position in aforementioned fields.

  - In this paper, we develop an exact closed-form series expansion for the economic index of riskiness of general gambles in terms of moments information. Important special cases include the economic indexes of riskinesses proposed in Aumann and Serrano (2008); Bali et al. (2011); Foster and Hart (2009). Based on the closed-form formula, we characterize further theoretical properties for the economic index of riskiness. Numerical examples confirm the accuracy of the proposed closed-form formula.

Submitted to _European Actuarial Journal_.
  - In this paper, we derive an exact explicit formula for the adjustment coefficient, which is the unique positive solution of the corresponding Lundberg equation. It is a key quantity in the classical Cram ́er-Lundberg risk theory, and is a fundamental building block for the celebrated Lundberg inequality for ruin probabilities. We utilize the Lagrange inversion theorem and derive the explicit exact formula in terms of series expansions. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the formula.
